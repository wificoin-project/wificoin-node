Wificoin Node
============

A Wificoin full node for building applications and services with Node.js. A node is extensible and can be configured to run additional services. At the minimum a node has an interface to Wificoind for more advanced address queries. Additional services can be enabled to make a node more useful such as exposing new APIs, running a block explorer and wallet service.
